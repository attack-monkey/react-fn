## The Low-down

React-fn is a functional approach to React. Take a look at this basic app below. You'll notice that State and Actions are decoupled from Components altogether, making things clean and simple.

- Components take in State and Actions
- Components can display State, but can only modify it via actions
- Upon state-change, the app refreshes

## Basic App

```tsx

// global state
const state = {
  greeting: 'hello world'
};

// functional component has state and actions passed in
const MyComponent = ({ state: any, actions: any }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{state.greeting}</h1>
    <button onClick={ actions.changeGreeting('hello ben') }>Change greeting</button>
    {/* Pass state and actions into any child components */}
    <childComponent state={state} actions={actions}></childComponent>
  </div>
);

// actions have the fn api passed in and fn.updateState can be used to update the App's State
const actions = (fn: Fn): any => {
  changeGreeting: (newGreeting) => fn.updateState('greeting', newGreeting)
}

// This is where your app will be mounted
const mount = document.querySelector('#app');

// run your app
app(state, MyComponent, actions, mount);

```

## Actions

Actions are functions that cause side-effects (Usually state changes).  
As you can see above, Actions are passed in to the first component.  
Actions are then passed down to child components.

### State

Rather than State existing within the components, it is stored in a single global state object.
State is just a pure javascript object (no methods).  
State is passed into the first component and can be passed down to child components.

Changing state is done in Actions via the `fn.updateState` method...

Let's say your state is 

```

some: {
  nested: {
    node: 'hello'
  }
}

```

and you want to make a change to `some.nested.node`, then...

```javascript

fn.updateState('some/nested/node', 'here i am');

```

State is now changed to 

```

some: {
  nested: {
    node: 'here i am'
  }
}

```

Whenever `fn.updateState` is called, the app is rerendered, unless the flag `rerender: false` is passed in ...

```javascript

// The following will not rerender the app
fn.updateState('some/nested/node', 'here i am', { rerender: false });

```

## The Advanced Guide

### The fn api

The fn api is accessible via actions.

#### getState

`fn.getState()` - Returns the current state of the app

#### updateState & updateMulti

`fn.updateState(node, value, options)` - Updates the state at a given node with the value.
The application will refresh unless `options.rerender` is set to false.
`node` can either be in directory format - eg. `a/nested/node` or an array of strings -eg. `[ 'a', 'nested', 'node']`

`fn.updateMulti([ { node: node, value: value }, {...} ], options)` - The same as `updateState`, however allows multiple updates to state at once.

eg. 

```typescript

fn.updateMulti([
  { node: 'a/nested/node', value: 'hello' },
  { node: 'another/node', value: 'hello again'}
], { rerender: false })

```

#### Chaining Actions with fn.relay()

`fn.relay()` - Allows actions to be played from other actions

#### Route Changes with fn.goto()

`fn.goto(route)` - Changes the URL to the new route. This updates `state.route` with the new url broken into segments.

eg. `myapp.com/page1/part_a` will produce `state.route` of `[ '', 'page1', 'part_a']`.

`fn.goto()` always triggers a state change and therefore an app refresh.

#### Dynamically add new actions with fn.addActions()

TODO

### Async Actions

Async code causes **closures** to be created.  
A closure takes a snapshot of State at the time it is created.  
While the State of the app continues to change outside of the cosure - the closure is none the wiser.  
The closure keeps it's own version of State.

To avoid the state in a closure from being out of sync with the rest of the app, use `fn.getState`, which ensures that the current state of the app is used...

```javascript

const actions = (fn: Fn) => {

  // emitNumber always increments the current state
  emitNumber() => {
    setInterval( () => {
      return fn.updateState('counter', fn.getState().counter + 1)
    }, 1000);
  }
  
}

```

### Engines. Actions that produce ongoing value streams

Engines are Asynchronous Actions that are able to be turned on and off. While in an 'on' state, they produce a value-stream (Multiple updates to State) until the 'off' switch is triggered.

A simple example is a button that when pushed, triggers a number to increment every second until the button is pushed again.

The actions for such an engine might look like...

```typescript

startCountEngine: () => {
  if ( !(fn.getState() as State).countEngine.active ) {
      const countEngineId = setInterval(() => {
          fn.updateState('countEngine/value', ( fn.getState() as State).countEngine.value + 1 )
      }, 1000);
      fn.updateMulti([
          { node: 'countEngine/active', value: true },
          { node: 'countEngine/id', value: countEngineId }
      ])
  }
  return;
},
stopCountEngine: () => {
    clearInterval((fn.getState() as State).countEngine.id);
    fn.updateMulti([
        { node: 'countEngine/active', value: false },
        { node: 'countEngine/id', value: undefined }
    ], { rerender: false })
    return;
}
```

This is all well and good, however sometimes we want to trigger an engine start when a particular component is in view and stop the engine when it is not.

React-Fn provides an `beforeRender` function to be provided as part of the app function's config object. This function takes in both State and Actions, and is called whenever the app is about to rerender (refresh).

By using `beforeRender`, and checking `state.route`, actions such as `stopCountEngine` can be called when a `route` meets a particular condition.

eg. The below example will trigger the `stopCountEngine` action when the route is myapp.com/page3.

```typescript

const appContainer = document.getElementById('app');

app(state, firstComponent, actions, appContainer, {
    beforeRender: (state: State, actions: Actions) => {
        switch(state.route[1]) {
            case 'page3':
                actions.stopCountEngine();
            break;
        }
    }
});

```

> Note: It's very important to set ` { rerender: false } ` on any state changes within `beforeRender`, otherwise the app will loop continuously as it tries to rerender, followed by rerender, etc.
